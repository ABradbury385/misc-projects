Ruby2d RPG

Description: 
This project takes place in a 2D world inhabited by Ruby the fox, a townsmember and a few robots. The robots have recently
gone haywire, and the town needs your help to fix all of the robots!

User Responsibilities:
The user can move around using WASD or the arrow keys. By pressing the 'c' key, Ruby launches a cog, which can fix robots
if it hits them! Ruby can talk to the frog NPC by pressing the 'x' key while near him.

Additional Features:
-There are spikes located around the world that hurt Ruby if she touches them
-The world is bounded on all sides by water, which Ruby cannot pass
-The camera pans with Ruby as she moves around the world
-There are 2 health collectibles located around the world in case Ruby is hurt
-A neat UI that displays Ruby's health and scales with screen size
-A froggy friend that gives Ruby her quest to fix the robots

Known Issues:
-Launching a cog and moving in the opposite direction of where the cog was first launched results in Ruby turning around
while still in the throwing animation.
-There is no in-game way to close the .exe file, Alt + F4 is advised.
