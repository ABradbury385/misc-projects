Random

Description: 
This project creates a random height terrain populated by various critters and props. The critters are found near the center
of the world, with a line of spiky blue-shelled leaders and a horde of red slimes behind them. Glowing mushrooms are 
scattered about a terrain for the player to explore using different camera views!

User Responsibilities:
The user can use the "c" key to change between multiple camera views of the world. The 6th camera is a first-person camera
where the user can move around using WASD and pan the camera by moving their mouse(see known issues).

Additional Features:
I added a different skybox that changes the atmosphere to night time and dimmed the directional world light to compensate.
Lightposts and trees with lamps on them are placed around the world to make the terrain feel a little more alive. 
I also placed collsion boxes around the terrain so that the player cannot fall off of the world while in the 
first-person camera.

Known Issues:
-The overhead camera can be panned vertically and the first person camera cannot pan up or down. 
Reinstalling fixes the issue in the Unity Editor but building recreates the issue.
-There is no in-game way to close the .exe file, I had to minimize the tab and close it from there.
